# Vestige-2.0-resources
This is a temporary repository to host my auth (pastebin auth $$$$) that I have full access on until quicks comes back (he has full access to the vestige v1 database, not me). I'm using it only for vestige beta 2.0. Most hosting websites don't accept crypto + I don't have enough money in my crypto wallets to host it for a long time.
